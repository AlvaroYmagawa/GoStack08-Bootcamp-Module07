## 1. To run this project, first run yarn in the project root to install all dependences
```
yarn
```

## 2. Now you need to run json-server to simulate a api.
```
# The server will run at port 3333
yarn json-server server.json -p 3333
```

## 3. After running the server we'll start the application.
```
yarn start
```
